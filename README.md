# SpaceGames
Just a simple Project, will continue to make it better. 


Want to play?
- install the complete complete repo, 
- install requiered dependencies: pygame only. 

- run main.py to launch game

In the future, I will try to convert this into an executable. 
P.S. The start is kind of tedious, you have to type in your player names and I am trying to work on a guide for instructions.
